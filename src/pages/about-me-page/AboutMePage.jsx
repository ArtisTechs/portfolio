        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a passionate computer engineering graduate with Latin honors,
          driven by a lifelong love for programming and software development,
          which began during my high school years. During my internship and
          self-paced learning, I earned certifications in web development and
          cloud computing, further fueling my enthusiasm for technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          For nearly a year, I have been honing my skills as a junior software
          engineer, in a local company, here in the Philippines. My primary responsibilities include
          coding and implementing new features for a timekeeping app and
          website. Additionally, I had the privilege of serving as the lead
          programmer on a viral prototype capstone project during my college
          years, where we developed a firefighting robot capable of autonomously
          extinguishing fires using a fire extinguisher.

          I thrive on challenges that push me to learn and grow, especially
          projects that involve creating interactive and user-friendly web
          applications. One of my proudest achievements remains our viral
          prototype project, which garnered significant attention online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technically, I am proficient in Angular and React frameworks, with
          strong skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Bootstrap. I also possess
          foundational knowledge of Python, C#, and Java. My eagerness to learn
          new technologies, coupled with my adaptability and collaborative
          spirit, drives me to continually expand my skill set.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, my aspirations in web development are anchored in
          continuous improvement and staying abreast of emerging technologies. I
          aspire to transition into strategic roles such as project management,
          where I can leverage my technical expertise to lead teams and align
          technical solutions with overarching business objectives. Ultimately,
          I see myself evolving into roles like technical lead or product
          manager, where I can play a pivotal role in shaping the future of
          innovative projects and driving technological advancements.
